title: OTP Developer and Product Owner Days 2024 Berlin
date: DEV: October 7-11 2024, PO: October 8-9 2024
---

The OTP developers are meeting in October in Berlin to discuss technical topics and to socialise. 
Even though this mini-conference is focussed on technical details everybody is welcome and just listening in is totally fine.

The OTP Product Owners are meeting for two days to kick-start the process of increased effectiveness in the PO team through facilitated discussions on purpose and common goals, clarifications of expectations, and a way of working within the OTP community. 

The event is free.
