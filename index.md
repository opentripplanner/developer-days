title: OTP Developer and Product Owner Days 2024 Berlin
date: October 7-11 2024 (developers), October 8-9 2024 (POs)
---

The OTP developers are meeting in October in Berlin to discuss technical topics and to socialise. 
Even though this mini-conference is focussed on technical details everybody is welcome and just listening in is totally fine.

The OTP Product Owners are meeting for two days to kick-start the process of increased effectiveness in the PO team through 
facilitated discussions on purpose and common goals, clarifications of expectations, and a way of working within the OTP community.

The event is free.

## Getting around the city

You can buy public transport tickets from the official [BVG Tickets App](https://www.bvg.de/en/subscriptions-and-tickets/all-apps/ticket-app) as
well as the route planning app [BVG Fahrinfo](https://www.bvg.de/en/subscriptions-and-tickets/all-apps/fahrinfo-app) (sadly not OTP-based). 
Ticket machines are also available at train and subway stations but not bus stops. Daily, weekly or tourist-oriented passes are available.

Berlin is flat and therefore cycling is a popular option. Some hotels offer a bike rental service. There are also the bike rental apps
[Call A Bike](https://www.callabike.de/en/home) and [Nextbike](https://www.nextbike.de/berlin/en/).

## Social events

There will dinners organised by Leonard on Monday, Tuesday and Friday night. Of course attendees
are free to go for dinner in any group(s) they wish.

If people are still in town on Saturday, there will be a longer trip, for example going to
[Sanssoussi Gardens](https://www.spsg.de/en/palaces-gardens/object/sanssouci-palace) or
a [sightseeing boat trip](https://www.sternundkreis.de/en/cruises/city-tour-from-friedrichstrasse-c8/).
